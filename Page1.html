        <h2>About Genshin Impact</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG with “gacha” mechanics. It is developed and published by Chinese studio miHoYo. In it, players control a number of party members, each with different abilities, weapons, gear, and personalities. The combat plays out in real time, allowing players to utilize ranged, melee, and elemental attacks against a wide array of enemies across the game’s open world and dungeons.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an online-only adventure that heavily leans into story and multiplayer — with many features you’d see in popular games as a service (like daily quests, rewards, loot, and other things to keep you checking in).</p>
