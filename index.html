            <h1>GENSHIN IMPACT</h1>
            <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG with “gacha” mechanics. It is developed and published by Chinese studio miHoYo. In it, players control a number of party members, each with different abilities, weapons, gear, and personalities. The combat plays out in real time, allowing players to utilize ranged, melee, and elemental attacks against a wide array of enemies across the game’s open world and dungeons.Genshin Impact is an online-only adventure that heavily leans into story and multiplayer — with many features you’d see in popular games as a service (like daily quests, rewards, loot, and other things to keep you checking in).</p>

            <h1>HONKAI IMPACT 3rd</h1>
            <p>On earth, a catastrophe known as the "Honkai" has plagued mankind throughout history.The Honkai was created alongside civilization, and creatures known as the "Honkai beasts", deadwalkers, as well as a paranormal humanoid - The Herrscher - were born within it. To fight the Honkai invasion, mankind created an organization, called the Schicksal. This organization was assembled by mankind as a means of resistance against the Honkai. Its creation also marked the beginning of a war, an eternal battle where no side has claimed victory. The fighting has continued to this day.Up until year 2013, when the 3rd Honkai War broke out in eastern Nagazora.</p>

            <h1>HONKAI: STAR RAIL</h1>
            <p>Honkai Star Rail is a newcomer-friendly turn-based RPG with an emphasis on strategic combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The game has a sci-fi theme and a visual style similar to previous HoYoverse games. Although the story takes place in the same galactic universe as the first Honkai game, Honkai Impact 3rd, Star Rail has its own standalone story. The characters are a mix of familiar and new faces.As Star Rail’s protagonist, you’ve been implanted with a Stellaron, a seed of ruin. The guy responsible for your predicament is Destruction, an Aeon (godlike creature) who believes that all civilization should be wiped out. Luckily, that won’t stop you from boarding the Astral Express and travelling through Star Rail’s universe. You’re not alone either; a group of passengers claiming to have inherited the “spirit of the Trailblaze” will join you on your adventures. </p>
